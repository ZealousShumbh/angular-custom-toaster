# Angular-Custom-Toaster

This repo is an assignment submitted by Shubham Pratap Singh for L1 Interview of Aubergine Solutions.

This is a small custom toaster application built from scratch without using any libraries. Due to the scoper & time given for the assignment, the custom toaster application only supports the title, message, placements of 4 types of toast notification - SUCCESS, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.

All the various projects/apps were all generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2 and above.
